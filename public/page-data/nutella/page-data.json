The Cigar rawhide sofa features a sturdy corner-blocked wooden frame and raw seams for that Malboro-person look. This brown leather sofa is cozy in a cottage, cabin, or a condo. And the leather (the leather!) becomes more beautiful with use: subtle character markings such as insect bites, healed scars, and grain variation reflects a real vintage. Saddle up and pass the remote.","currentInventory":14,"id":"d14c82f0-d285-48f6-b08c-9eb50c4251e4"},"title":"Nutella","type":"itemPage","next":{"categories":["autre"],"name":"Huile de Tournesol","pro_price":"0.86","autre_price":"0.86","image":"../images/products/tournesol-removebg-preview.png","description":"You know your dad’s incredible vintage bomber jacket? The Nirvana dakota tan leather sofa is that jacket, but in couch form. With super-plush down-filled cushions, a corner-blocked wooden frame, and a leather patina that only gets better with age, the Nirvana will have you looking cool and feeling peaceful every time you take a seat. Looks pretty great with a sheepskin throw, if we may say so. With use, this leather will become softer and more wrinkled and the cushions will take on a lived-in look, like your favorite leather jacket.","brand":"Jason Bourne","currentInventory":2,"id":"baf40f39-13e1-410a-b2a3-46e67bfad0e8"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["409475740","409475740"]}
